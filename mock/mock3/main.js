Certain words/phrases have been printed in <b>bold</b> to help you locate them while answering some of the questions.<br><br> Long ago, a Brahmin called Haridatta lived in a little village. He was a farmer but the piece of land he cultivated provided him with so little to survive on that he was very poor. <br><br>One day, unable to stand in the heat of the summer Sun, he went to rest for a while under a big tree on his land. Before he could <b>stretch</b> out on the ground, he saw a huge black cobra slithering out of an anthill nearby. The snake then spread his hood and swayed gracefully from side to side. Haridatta was <b>astonished</b> to see this and he thought, “This cobra must really be the god of this land. I have never seen or worshiped him before, which is probably why I am not able to get anything from the land. From this day onwards, I will worship him.” He hurried back to his home at once and returned with a glass full of milk. He poured it into a bowl and turning to the anthill said, “O ruler of the land, I did not know you were living in this anthill. That is why I have not paid my tribute to you. Please accept my apologies for this omission and accept this <b>humble</b> offering.” He then placed the bowl of milk at the entrance of the anthill and left the place. <br> The next day when the Brahmin arrived to work on his land before the Sun rose, he found a gold coin in the bowl he had left at the anthill. He was very happy indeed and from that day on, he made it a practice to offer the cobra milk in a bowl each day. The next morning he would collect a gold coin and leave. <br>One day Haridatta had to go to a neighbouring village on business. He asked his son to go to the anthill as usual and leave a bowl of milk for the cobra. The son did as he was told, but when he went to the same spot the next day and collected the gold coin he thought, “This anthill must be full of gold. If I kill the cobra, I can collect all the gold<b> in an instant</b>, instead of having to waste my time coming here everyday”. He then struck the cobra with a big stick. The cobra <b>deftly</b> dodged the blow but bit Haridatta’s son with liis poisonous fangs. The boy soon died. When Haridatta returned to his village the next day, he heard how his son had met his death. He relized at once that his son’s greed would probably have caused him to attack the cobra. The Brahmin went to the anthill the day after his son’s cremation and offered milk to the cobra as usual. This time, the cobra did not even come out of his hole. Instead he called out to Haridatta, “You have come here for gold, forgetting that you have just lost a precious son and that you are in mourning. The reason for this is pure greed. From today, there is no meaning to our relationship. I am going to give you a diamond as a final gift. But please don’t ever come back again.” He slithered away as the Brahmin watched.<hr> Which of the following is true according to the story?",
